# Tracking the National Government's Covid-19 Aid Spending

This is a dashboard built as a part of a coursework for MSc in Computational and Data Journalism at Cardiff University.

This analytical dashboard contains information on the Philippine national governmentâ€™s spending on social and economic assistance to Filipinos during the covid-19 pandemic. The current version covers data from 17 March to 31 August 2020, but a few portions reflect data as of 4 November 2020. It is planned to be manually updated on a weekly basis or as data becomes available.

It was intended to support journalists covering the pandemic in the Philippines, but it may also be used by researchers, budget transparency advocates, and the public interested in aid data.


## Navigate this site

The dashboard has seven sections. The first section displays the total amount set aside by the national government to address the pandemic and that spent on aid. The subsequent sections break down the total aid allocation into six areas of analysis: 1) areas of focus, 2) disbursement timeline, 3) implementing agencies, 4) types of aid, 5) types of beneficiaries, and 6) location of beneficiaries. Each section contains labels and visual elements. Five visual elements feature user interactions, such as clickable elements and filtering options.

Data is presented in interactive graphs and made available for download.
